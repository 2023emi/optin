the fall of both PE CE today assured me that thetha gamma etc dont matter unless not taken into account the thing 4emasp or even normal ma's etc indicators mirror the human group moves as an entity etc etc 


Key to consistantly making it is to enter assured move like above one fast and stay in move till comfortable according to captial invested large move out in 5% even .. min ok 

today i choosed otm 19700PE when both of the CE PE were falling but CE seemed to fall more and at 11:00 am entry should have been made with large cap 25000 min to get 5% proft and out 
54.20 : : 68.55 10% current 11:10

look chart for entry assurance techniqals



seemed better to go for m03 most of time in ana
